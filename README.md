# University News Scraper

##### This project is a python script that scrapes news headlines and URLs from my university news page and sends a summary message with the headlines and URLs to a designated phone number using the Twilio API. The script is deployed on an AWS Lambda function and is scheduled to run every day at 10pm. This allows for easy daily updates on university news without the need to constantly check the website.
